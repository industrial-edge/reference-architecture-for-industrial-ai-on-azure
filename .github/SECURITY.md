## Security Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in the code and believe it may harm other users, and you are willing to help us fix it but do not wish to disclose the details publicly.

**Please send detailed information to our email: industrialedge.industry@siemens.com.**

The email subject format should be: `[Security Vulnerability] <Title>`

Please provide detailed steps to reproduce the security vulnerability, its impact, and we will reply and express our gratitude upon receiving your email.

We will acknowledge your contribution by adding your name to the `readme.md` and `code`!
