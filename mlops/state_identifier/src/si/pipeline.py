Building blocks for scikit-learn pipelines.

To train the classifier in such a pipeline, the input data must be fed through the preprocessing
steps during the training process.
Therefore, this processing pipeline has to be defined before the training, as part of data preparation.
This is where the building blocks in the AI SDK come into play.

These building blocks are based on the widely used machine learning Python package scikit-learn.
Scikit-learn provides a framework to define pipelines, which lets you combine data transformers with classifiers
or other kinds of estimators. The building blocks are located in module `simaticai.pipeline`.
The essential ones are:

- `WindowTransformer`, which transforms a series of input rows into a series of windows of rows and

- `FeatureTransformer`, which transforms a window of rows into a feature value according to user defined functions.

In addition to these transformers, there is a transformer named `FillMissingValues` which performs input
data correction for simple cases. For more advanced
cases, you should use a more sophisticated imputer to fix your input.

For more details and concrete examples, please refer to the training notebooks in the State Identifier
project template.
We also recommend studying the documentation of scikit-learn if you would like to understand in-depth
how scikit-learn works or want to implement your own transformers.
